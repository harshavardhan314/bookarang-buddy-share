Bookarang – A Community-Driven Book Lending Platform
Bookarang is an innovative web-based platform designed to make book access more affordable and sustainable by enabling peer-to-peer book lending within local communities. Aimed especially at students and avid readers, Bookarang connects users who own idle books with those looking to borrow them temporarily at a minimal cost.

The platform allows users to list books they own by providing details such as condition, location, and original price. Borrowers can search for books nearby and request to borrow them for a selected duration. The borrowing process involves a fully refundable deposit, with a small service fee based on the book’s condition, duration, and market value. Lenders earn a portion of this fee, incentivizing participation and promoting circular usage of books.

Bookarang emphasizes local lending to avoid logistics costs by encouraging direct meetups between users in the same city or locality. The platform features Google OAuth for login, location-based search via Google Maps API, ISBN autofill using Open Library/Google Books API, and storage/notifications through Supabase. Users also receive in-site reminders, and the system includes a rating mechanism to ensure reliability and accountability among borrowers.
